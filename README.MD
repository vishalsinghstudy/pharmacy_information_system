# PHARMACY INFORMATION SYSTEM

# PHARMACY INFORMATION SYSTEM : A FRAMEWORK FOR AUTOMATED PRESCRIPTION AND REAL-TIME STOCK MONITORING 

Pharmacy Information control mechanisms tailored within a Profit management framework to maximize resource cost has been proposed.

Existing abstractions for in-memory storage on clusters, such as distributed shared memory, key value stores, databases, and Piccolo, offer an interface based on fine-grained updates to mutable state (e.g., cells in a table).

It is fine-tuned to predict the load of its cluster. The final load of the whole grid is obtained by summing the loads of each cluster. 


# Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.

# Getting Started

1. Automate Prescription Management:
Streamline the process of generating, managing, and tracking prescriptions
Reduce human errors in prescription creation and medication dispensin.

2. Real-Time Stock Monitoring:
Continuously monitor inventory levels to ensure medications are adequately stocked.
Provide real-time alerts for low stock, expired medications, or items approaching expiry.

3. Improve Efficiency and Accuracy:
Eliminate manual processes to reduce inefficiencies in handling prescriptions and inventory.
Ensure data accuracy in stock levels, prescriptions, and reports.


# Features
The "pharmacy information system: a framework for automated prescription and real-time stock monitoring" project, focusing on the report features. You can adjust these according to your specific project needs:

# Prescription Management Report
         -   Purpose:  Provides a detailed overview of all prescriptions issued over a specified period.

# Real-Time Stock Report
           - Purpose: Monitors stock levels in real-time and provides insights into inventory.

# Sales and Revenue Report
          - Purpose: Shows revenue generated through sales of medications and prescriptions.

# Supplier Inventory Report
         -  Purpose: Tracks inventory supplied by different vendors and suppliers.

# Pharmacy Performance Report
         -  Purpose: Provides insights into the overall performance of the pharmacy.




# Conclusion
Summarize lessons learned from the development process.

Highlight key achievements and improvements made to traditional systems through automation.

Add a reflection on future scalability and how the system could evolve with the needs of modern healthcare.

The system provides an intuitive, easy-to-use interface for pharmacists, doctors, and administrative staff.

Minimal training is required, allowing users to quickly adapt to the system.
